# Delivery_Time_Prediction(ETA)

## Project Overview

The Food Delivery Time Prediction Model aims to estimate the time required for food to be delivered to customers accurately. By providing precise delivery time predictions, the model enhances customer experience, optimizes delivery logistics, and improves overall operational efficiency for food delivery platforms.

## a) Data Collection
• Gathered the food delivery dataset from the provided data source and The dataset used for this project is located in the dataset folder and includes order details, location, city, delivery person information, weather conditions, and actual delivery times.

## b) Data Preprocessing
• Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. • Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features for the prediction model.

## c) Model Development
• Utilized regression algorithms to train the food delivery time prediction model. • Explored models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost to determine the best-performing model.

## d) Model Evaluation
• Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) score.

## e) Deployment
• Deployed the food delivery time prediction model as a standalone application using Streamlit. • Integrated OpenCage API for geolocation functionality in the application.

## OpenCage API Integration
• The application uses the OpenCage API for geolocation to convert addresses into latitude and longitude, with the relevant code snippet located in the main.py file.
